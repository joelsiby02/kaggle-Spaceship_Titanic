# Kaggle Project: Spaceship Titanic

This repository contains my submission for the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle project. It was an exciting and challenging experience for me, and I'm thrilled to share my progress and results with you.

## Project Description

The Spaceship Titanic project is a classification problem where the goal is to predict the survival of passengers onboard the Titanic. The dataset provided includes various features such as age, gender, passenger class, and cabin information, which are used to build a model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Files and Folders

- `space_titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `kaggle_submission.csv`: CSV file containing the final predictions for the test dataset.
-  `gboosted.pkl` : my model package
-  `Kaggle.jpeg` : My current leaderBoard Position

## Approach

In this project, I followed the typical data science pipeline to solve the classification problem. Here are the main steps I took:

1. Data Exploration: I analyzed the provided dataset to gain insights into the features, missing values, and relationships between variables.
2. Data Preprocessing: I handled missing values, performed feature engineering, and prepared the data for model training.
3. Model Training: I experimented with various classification algorithms, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, using pipelines for preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.
4. Model Evaluation: I evaluated the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and compared their performance to select the best model.
5. Final Submission: I made predictions on the test dataset using the selected model and created a submission file for Kaggle.

## Results

After rigorous experimentation and fine-tuning, I achieved a submission with an accuracy of 80.3 %. While the result is satisfying, I believe there is still room for improvement, and I look forward to further refining my approach and exploring new techniques in future Kaggle projects.

## Conclusion

Participating in the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle project has been an incredible learning experience. It allowed me to apply my data science skills, explore various algorithms, and gain insights into the Titanic dataset. I'm grateful for the opportunity and excited to continue my journey in the world of data science.

Feel free to explore the notebook and submission file for more details. If you have any suggestions or questions, please let me know.

Happy coding and data exploring!
